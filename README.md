# SIMON-32-64

SIMON-SPACK Family are a very light weight encryption algorithm designed to work on constrained devices.

Implementation of 32/64 version of SIMON lightweight block cipher family

In this project the 32/64 version of SIMON lightweight block cipher family will be implemented for assessment and evaluation of its security, randomness and implementation complexity. The security will be evaluated by applying cross correlation for both input as a (White Noise) and corresponding output (ciphertext) and analyzing the results.

The security analysis will mostly be applied on the block cipher itself in ECB mode, without forming any specific encryption modes that will increase its security, such as CFB, CTR or CBC.
